About Laser Kombat

Laser Kombat is currently in the Alpha testing stage. When Alpha testing and
level design are complete, the release version will be available for download
from http://www.olympus.net/personal/dewey/laser/. If you would like to
be an official Alpha tester and level designer, email David Dewey at dd@olympus.net.
You may also send levels, bug reports, questions, and comments and suggestions
to this address.

Making levels

Please make some levels for Laser Kombat using the LevelEditor. If you send your
levels to me at dd@olympus.net, they may be incorporated in the final release
of the game and you will get your name in the credits and/or help file.

To be played, levels must be saved in the directory containing LaserKombat.exe. The first
level must be named level001.lvl, and subsequent levels must follow the same
format, with successively higher numbers. You may not skip numbers.
